                <h2>What is CharaEngine?</h2>
                <p>In a survey we conducted recently, we found out that most gamers believe Non Player Characters to be an important part of the gaming experience.
                    However, many of them also thought that interacting with them was “not satisfying, boring, repetitive or simply not fun”</p>
                <p>We also found out that 65 % of Japanese and European gamers would like to play games implementing generative AI-powered NPCs, and another survey conducted in North America mentions 84 % of players interested</p>

                    <img src="./images/lightningbolt.svg"/>
                    <p>This gave us the idea of creating an AI character engine for NPCs aimed at video games studios</p>
                    <p>Once build, our AI character engine will allow studios to create, customize and integrate NPCs in their games easily and securely</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>The aim of our character engine is not to replace narrative designers, but to help them focus on their core job: 
                        Creating enjoyable worlds
                        Engaging storylines and 
                        Main characters for the players   </p>
